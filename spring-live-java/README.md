# Hot reloading in java

Source of Spring learning: https://spring.io/quickstart

Created project using https://youtu.be/a7-v6PW1458?t=213 . Thanks to this guy!

**Running project:** To run the project in _watch mode_ run `./mvnw spring-boot:run` only and it watches automatically for changes.

**TIP**: You can simply use `./start-development.sh` to run it too.

**Live reload extension for chrome**: Needs to be enabled by clicking on the icon in the extension bar(in the tool tip it'll show you the the status i.e, if its enabled or disabled). Src: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei/related?hl=en
